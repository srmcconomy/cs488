The puppet is set up in a logical way.  One thing that I did was I made sure
that every joint node has no transformations initially, so any translations/
scaling I needed to do on joints was instead done on an invisible node that is
a parent to the joint.

Each joint has a degree of freedom, except for the neckJoint which has two
The waistJoint rotates around the Y axis (so it is controlled by the middle mouse button)


Changes that I made to the data structures:
I added a parent SceneNode to each SceneNode
I created a static map of SceneNodes that I can access using their id
I overrode rotate in JointNode to prevent rotating too far

I did not have time to implement undoing and redoing.
Other than that there are no additional or missing features.

I ran this program on gl29.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca
